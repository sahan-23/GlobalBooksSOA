## Completed Tasks

- **Task 1-6: SOAP Service Implementation**

  - Successfully designed, implemented, and tested the SOAP-based `CatalogService`.
  - The service exposes a WSDL endpoint, and its operations were verified to work as expected.

- **Task 7-8: REST Service Implementation**
  - Successfully designed and implemented the REST-based `OrdersService` using Spring Boot.
  - The service exposes a `/orders` endpoint that can receive and process basic order requests in JSON format, verified using Postman.

---

## In-Progress Tasks

- **Task 9-11: Service Integration & BPEL Orchestration**
  - The process of integrating the two services was started.
  - However, significant technical challenges and time constraints were encountered while attempting to configure the BPEL orchestration environment (Apache ODE). These setup complexities prevented the successful completion of the service integration and orchestration tasks.

---

## Pending Tasks

- **RabbitMQ Integration:** Asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ was not started.
- **Security Implementation:** Security features for the services were not implemented.

---

## Conclusion

The foundational SOAP and REST microservices were successfully built and tested, demonstrating the core objectives of the initial tasks. The advanced integration and orchestration tasks were initiated but could not be completed due to unforeseen complexities in the environment setup and the project timeline.
